# ShefBots

We're into #PiWars. Expect posts detailing our journey to building a robot for the 2024 competition (originally 2020...). From hardware and design to electronics and [software](https://github.com/ShefBots), there'll be something for everyone. For the curious, our basic design will include mecanum wheels, a gripper, LiPo cells, a camera, and of course, a Raspberry Pi.
